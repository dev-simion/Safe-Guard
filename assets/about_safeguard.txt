About Safeguard

Safeguard is a next-generation safety app built to protect students and individuals from bullying, violence, or emergencies in real-time.
With one tap, users can send instant SOS alerts to nearby authorities, school security, or trusted contacts — sharing their live location, photos, and emergency details within seconds.

Our mission is simple: to create safer communities through technology.
We believe no one should ever feel helpless or unheard in moments of danger. Safeguard empowers users with quick access to help, even in silent or high-pressure situations.

Safeguard isn’t just an app — it’s a digital guardian that watches over you when it matters most.
From schools to communities, we’re building a safer future, one alert at a time.
